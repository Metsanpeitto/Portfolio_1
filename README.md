### Project requirements

_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. [Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/multiple_pull_requests.md)._

- For this project, you should add the [JavaScript linter](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/javascript).
- In mobile, implement the following features:
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button, the mobile menu appears.
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the mobile menu disappears.
  - When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, the mobile menu disappears.
