## Learning objectives

- Describe core principles of building accessible websites and explain why accessibility is important.

- Check the online version of your portfolio and make sure that the page works properly.
- Update the README of your repository to include a link to the online version.

=======

## Built With

- HTML/SCSS
- Node.JS
- Figma

=======

## Getting Started

If you want to visit the deployed app just visit the following link:

- [`https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Portfolio_1/`](https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Portfolio_1/)

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it

- `git clone https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/Portfolio_1`

After cloning it you can see the project opening the index.html file with your favorite browser ( Firefox for example )

### Project requirements

IMPORTANT NOTE: For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way.

- Check all of the items listed in the article Easy Checks ‚Äì A First Review of Web Accessibility (which you already read in the previous lesson).
- Determine if your Portfolio needs any changes.
- Prepare a report listing all points that you have checked, and the result of your evaluation.
- Prepare a report about your evaluation:
- List all points that you have checked, i.e:
- Page titles
- Image text alternatives\*\* (<img alt="alt text">)
- Text headings
- Color contrast
- Resize
- Interaction
- Moving content
- Multimedia
- The basic structure of the page
- Each point on the list needs to include the result of your evaluation:
- If everything was ok, make a statement about that (e.g. "Page titles - no issues found").
- If you needed to change something, link to the corresponding line of code in your Pull Request changes.
- Add your report to the description of your pull request.
- You need to use pair-programming for this project. Therefore you need to select one of the portfolios in your pair-programming group in which you will implement the above features.

### Prerequisites

- Node.JS
