## Getting Started

If you want to visit the deployed app just visit the following link:

- [`https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Portfolio_1/`](https://metsanpeitto.github.io/Portfolio_1/)

If you want a copy of this file go to the github repository and download it

- `git clone https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/Portfolio_1`

After cloning it you can see the project opening the index.html file with your favorite browser ( Firefox for example )

### Project requirements

- You need to implement a simple validation:
- The content of the email field has to be in lower case.
- You should implement the following interactions:
- When the user submits the form, you check if the email is in lower case.
- If the validation is OK, the form is sent.
- If the validation is not OK, you show an error message to the user near the submit button informing them of the error and the form is not sent.

### Prerequisites

- Node.JS
